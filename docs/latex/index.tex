This is the documentation for the Tri\+Ped Projects joint level controller. It implements the Hardware Interfaces required by \href{http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control}{\tt ros\+\_\+control} to interface the joint position and trajectory controllers with the sensors and actuators. The Motors and Sensors for each joint are specified in the \href{https://github.com/TriPed-Robot/Wiki/wiki/One-Legged-Sub-Robot}{\tt wiki} along with their naming conventions.\hypertarget{index_Setting}{}\section{Up the Beaglebone}\label{index_Setting}
In order to use the joint controller the I/O of the Beaglebone black has to be set up according to the \href{https://github.com/TriPed-Robot/Wiki/wiki/Beaglebone-Setup}{\tt beaglebone setup guide} Afterwards the sensors and actuators have to be connected according to the \href{https://github.com/TriPed-Robot/Wiki/wiki/Wiring-diagram}{\tt wiring diagram}.
